**GENERAL IDEA**
===================================================================================================================================================================================

**1**. Free Agency (FA) opens after week 3. (Snake Draft Style)

**2.** A-Team gets the first choice on the FA waiver wire, starting from lowest standing teams and up to the highest. They can only pick up one FA and then it's the next team's turn to pick. If any of the teams pick up a FA but their roster is full, then they have to drop one of their players. That player is put into an alternative "Dropped Players Wire" - more about that in the last section.

**3.** Any free agents that weren't picked up in the A-Team FA waiver wire get moved down to the B-Team FA waiver wire. Proceeding the same way the A-Team FA waiver wire does; picks go from lowest to highest; Dropped players go to the B-Team "Dropped Players Wire".


**DROPPED PLAYERS WIRE**
===================================================================================================================================================================================


**A**.   If any of the teams pick up a FA but their roster is full, then they have to drop one of their players. That player is then 
     put into an alternative "dropped players wire" (DPW - example) and then after the FA period for the week is over, the DPW is available. 
     The A-Teams proceed as if it was FA (lowest standings - to highest), and choose whether or not to pick up a dropped player.
     (The team that dropped a player will not be able to pick them back up in the DPW). In case the team has a full 
     roster already when picking up a dropped player, then they must drop someone on their roster, the system repeats.
     After the third week (1st FA period), whenever a player is dropped, they can only be picked up from the DPW after the week's FA period is over.

**B**.   If any of the players in the DPW don't get picked up, then they get moved down to the B-Team DPW. 
     The B-Team DPW will work the same as the A-Team DPW, and will always happen after the B-Team FA waiver wire.

**C.**   If any of the players were not picked during the B-Team DPW, then they will be available for the next A-Team DPW, and the system repeats.
