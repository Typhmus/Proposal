**GENERAL IDEA**
===================================================================================================================================================================================

**1**. Free Agency (FA) opens after week 3 or week 4, depending on how many players are available. (Snake Draft Style)

**2.** A-Team gets the first choice on the FA waiver wire, starting from lowest standing teams and up to the highest. They can only pick up one FA and then it's the next team's turn to pick. If any of the teams pick up a FA but their roster is full, then they have to drop one of their players. That player is put into an alternative "Dropped Players Wire" - more about that in the last section.

**3.** Any free agents that weren't picked up in the A-Team FA waiver wire get moved down to the B-Team FA waiver wire. Proceeding the same way the A-Team FA waiver wire does; picks go from lowest to highest; Dropped players go to the B-Team "Dropped Players Wire".



**DROPPED PLAYERS WIRE**
===================================================================================================================================================================================


**A**.   If any of the teams pick up a FA but their roster is full, then they have to drop one of their players. That player is then 
     put into an alternative "dropped players wire" (DPW - example) and then after the FA period for the week is over, the DPW is available. 
     The A-Teams proceed as if it was FA (lowest standings - to highest), and choose whether or not to pick up a dropped player.
     (The team that dropped a player will not be able to pick them back up in the DPW). In case the team has a full 
     roster already when picking up a dropped player, they must drop someone on their roster, that person will then be put on the B-Team DPW.
     After the third week (1st FA period), whenever a player is dropped, they can only be picked up from the DPW after the week's FA period is over.

**B**.   If any of the players in the DPW don't get picked up, then they get moved down to the B-Team DPW. 
     The B-Team DPW will work the same as the A-Team DPW, and will always happen after the B-Team FA waiver wire.

**C.**   If any of the players were not picked during the B-Team DPW, then they will be available for the next A-Team DPW, B-Team DPW and the system repeats until the dropped player either asks to get himself removed from the DPW, or until the last week of the regular season. If the player isn't chosen by the last week's DPW, then he will be freely available to merc for any team that asks for it during the playoff matches; otherwise, he/she cannot play in the league.
     
  - The team that asks for a DPW merc first, gets to use them first. After the team's match is over, the player will be sent back to the DPW merc pool and can still merc            for any other playoff matches.

  - If a team asks a merc to show up, and the merc agrees, but the merc does not show up, it can be marked as ghosting a team. If the merc didn't respond to the GM, or  didn't say that he can show up during the official matchday, then it won't be marked towards ghosting. 

**D.**   If an A-Team decides to call up a B-Teamer, and has a full roster, then they will need to drop one of their players. That player will also be put into the A-Team DPW. If they don't get picked up to another A-Team, then they go to the B-Team DPW. -- Proceeds to Step C.

**E.**   Free Agency ends at the second-to-last week of the regular season. The DPW will continue until the last week.

**G.**   If a B-Team player is banned from playing for their team or banned in anyway that prevents them from playing, then their team will recieve a movement change based on the round that the banned player was drafted. The movement change will only give them higher priority in the FA Waiver Wire.

This is only a repersentation of what it will be like (Based on the current season). 

    - Round 1:  +5 
    - Round 2:  +4
    - Round 3:  +3
    - Round 4:  +3
    - Round 5:  +3
    - Round 6:  +2
    - Round 7:  +2
    - Round 8:  +2
    - Round 9:  +1
    - ROund 10: +1


**WHAT DOES THIS SOLVE?**
===================================================================================================================================================================================

**1. The incentive for teams (especially B-Team) to lose on purpose in their first few matchdays to recieve better Free Agents is completely removed.**

With the current way it works, any B-Team that is good and properly drafted will be at a disadvantage if they win their games, because any team that loses all of their games will be able to pick up those A-Team Free Agents. In a normal B-League, there is a very big difference between B-Teamers and A-Teamers. Having a great full B-Team lineup will not be up to par with a B-Team lineup that has a few A-Team level players. 

However, this problem also happens on the other end. There is a high possibility that any good and properly drafted B-Team can throw their first few matchdays and then pick up A-Team level Free Agents and enhance their already good team, while other teams that are potentially not already good based on the draft will be at a disadvantage because they couldn't pick up the best players, when they have way worse rosters.

**- How these changes solve this problem:** 
In this new system, the Free Agency period will start after week 3 or week 4. This means that teams won't have the incentive to throw early on, and instead winning your early matches will have way more importance. This also means there will be an almost certified chance that the actual bad teams will be at the bottom of the standings (the teams that need the FAs more than any other team). 

**2. Free Agency will be way more balanced.**

In the current system, FA is a blind bid, meaning that GMs will have to bid their WPs (the same WPs which causes the incentives to lose) on free agents and hope that their bid is the highest. They also have to choose a first priority pick and a second priority pick. That means that if their first pick wasn't the highest bid, then they still have a chance to get their second priority pick if they had the highest bid. 

While this means that bad teams can use their wavier points to grab players, it also invites the idea of unfair pickups. You could have one team pick up two of the best Free Agents because the other teams didn't want to risk the chance of not getting a free agent because they don't think they would have enough WP to bid on the best ones. 

**- How these changes solve this problem:**

Because free agency is a snake draft, it means that teams know exactly who is available to be picked up, and exactly when they can pick. This also means that teams won't be able to choose more than one agent on their turn, so in the case of B-Team: more A-Team level free agents = more B-teams that can pick them up, and that means less of a chance one team will get an unfair amount of them (which you can naturally do in blind bids). 
For A-Team, there is already way less of a chance that any teams will get unfair pickups, so this doesn't apply as much to it as it does to B-Team. However, it is still better than blind bidding because there is almost no chance of unfair pickups, while with blind bids, there is still a high chance.

**DPW will make teams even more balanced:**

The next part to make this even better is the DPW system. This means that any dropped players from A-Team still have a chance to be on A-Team even though they were dropped. This is great for players that end up getting dropped because there was someone that was "Slightly" better than them, either because of a callup from B-Team, or because of a Free Agent. That "slightly worse" player can still be put on another A-Team that needs them. Because this system would be in form of a snake draft, just like free agency, it also means that in case there aren't a lot of free agents available, teams can still pick up dropped players and it'll be balanced across most of the teams.

For B-Team, it provides the opportunity for ALL TEAMS to get a player that they need, either from the A-Team drops, B-Team drops, or still from the FA period.

Overall, this means that all teams can be properly balanced in terms of players, while in the current system, teams could become easily unfair.
